- Lazy initialize data in Item to safe memory

- Run SinfoniaHashMap test with lots of entries and file based memory node

- implement more basic data structures like List, Set, etc.

- how is a DataItem initialized? initial revision, type... (some kind of alloc?)

Major topics:

- Replication / primary-backup implementation for MemoryNodes

- Replicated versions of Items (->Sinfonia paper)

- BTree implementation
